Problem Statement

    	
The people of RGB Street have decided to paint each of their houses red, green, or blue. They've also decided that no two neighboring houses will be painted the same color. The neighbors of house i are houses i-1 and i+1. The first and last houses are not neighbors.

You will be given a String[] houses, where the ith element corresponds to house i. Each element of houses will be formatted as "R G B" (quotes for clarity only), where R, G and B are the costs of painting the corresponding house red, green, and blue, respectively. Return the minimal total cost required to perform the work.

{"1 100 100", "100 100 100", "1 100 100"}
Returns: 102
The minimum possible cost is 102, and there are two solutions that result in that cost: "RGR" and "RBR".
