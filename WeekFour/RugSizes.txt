Problem Statement

    	Rugs come in various sizes. In fact, we can find a rug with any integer width and length, except that no rugs have a distinct width and length that are both even integers. For example, we can find a 4x4 rug, but not a 2x4 rug. We want to know how many different choices we have for a given area.
Create a class RugSizes the contains a method rugCount that is given the desired area and returns the number of different ways in which we can choose a rug size that will cover that exact area. Do not count the same size twice -- a 6 x 9 rug and a 9 x 6 rug should be counted as one choice.

 
Definition

    	
Class:	RugSizes
Method:	rugCount
Parameters:	int
Returns:	int
Method signature:	int rugCount(int area)
(be sure your method is public)
    
 
Constraints

-	area will be between 1 and 100,000, inclusive.
 
Examples

0)	
    	
4
Returns: 2
The choices are 1 x 4 (or equivalently 4 x 1) and 2 x 2.
1)	
    	
8
Returns: 1
Only 1 x 8 is available. Note that 2 x 4 has the desired area, but is not available since its width and length differ and are both even numbers.
